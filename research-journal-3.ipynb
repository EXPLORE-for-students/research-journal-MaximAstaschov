    "1. Set up a test environment for a new model, which plots both models and also the difference between them\n",
    "2. Implemented a new model into the colossus code, which is a simple copy of the Adhikari14 model already existing there\n",
    "3. Generated the s and Om values as bins and compared to the LUT -> 0m is linspace while s is geomspace\n",
    "4. Changed the intervals to the given intervals in [2]\n",
    "5. Implemented Delta_sp in the form of the given fitting function in [2]\n",
    "6. Let the test environment run both models -> They differ by around 6% in some parts, which is slightly more than the promised ~5% in [2]\n",
    "7. Could not find an error in the code itself and looked up possible ways to implement the model itself\n",
