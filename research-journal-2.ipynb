    "1. Searching for the data sources consisted of mainly following along the \"Data\" part of the paper\n",
    "2. While doing so some data source were not properly linked or not available anymore, I had to search through other sources which has the risk of them being not the exact data set that was used\n",
    "3. After that I tried plotting the figure 9 with the help of the data set in the KiDS paper, but realized that I would have to repeat the steps of the paper to get the model-values, which I didn't have the time for\n",
    "4. Instead I used the model-values given in the paper to plot the data-based-result of the paper against the models programmed in Colossus\n",
    "5. Also I imported colossus and modified the splashback.py file in a way that enables me to add the generalized Adhikari model to the Splashback-models\n",
